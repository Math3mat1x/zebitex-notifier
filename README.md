# Zebitex notifier

Change the dictionnary in data.json to set a high and low value for a given market (there is an example provided). Once the price of the given markets hits one of either value, you are being notified.
Then, the last value of the list for a given market changes to true, which means you wonâ€™t be notified again.

Example data.json:
{'btceur': [46000, 38200, false], 'etheur': [3455, 2390, false]}

You have to manually modify message.py to get notified in your preferred way.
